Add delicate floral arrangements in the corners and edges of the frame, featuring soft pastel roses, peonies, and small delicate flowers with green leaves. The floral elements should create a romantic and decorative border that gracefully frames the invitation, while maintaining a clean and sophisticated look. The flowers should have a watercolor-like appearance with subtle shading and natural, organic shapes. Ensure the center area remains clear for text placement. The overall style should be elegant and timeless with a modern touch.",
